Core Languages:
TypeScript: This is the primary language used for writing the application code, adding type safety to JavaScript.
CSS: Used for styling, especially in the globals.css file where the theme variables are defined.

Frameworks & Major Libraries:
Next.js: The core framework built on top of React. It handles routing, server-side rendering, and the overall application structure.
React: The fundamental UI library used to create all the components and manage the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for all the styling. It allows for rapid UI development by using classes directly in the markup.
Genkit: The framework used to connect to and manage generative AI models from Google.
ShadCN UI: This is not a traditional component library but a collection of reusable UI components (like Buttons, Cards, etc.) that are built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

Key Libraries & Tools:
Lucide React: For all the icons you see throughout the portfolio.
React Hook Form & Zod: Used together for robust form validation, as seen in the "Connect" section's contact form.
clsx & tailwind-merge: Utility libraries that help manage and merge Tailwind CSS classes conditionally.

In short, it's a modern web application built with a TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS stack.
